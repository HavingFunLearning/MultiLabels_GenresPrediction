# MultiLabels_GenresPrediction

- the dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raman77768/movie-classifier)
- I learnt about multi-label classification and its difference with multi-class classification!
- I reviewed the difference between the softmax and the sigmoid!
- I revieed the binary cross entropy and how it can be applied for multi-labels classification!
- I discovered how in Keras the implementation of accuracy differs:
    - Accuracy is thought for predictions (0/1)
    - Binary_accuracy is thought for probs (applies a 0.5 threshold to get a prediction)
